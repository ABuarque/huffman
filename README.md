# Huffman
Huffman implementation in C

## Code style contract
+ Curly braces
	+ On body function: ***same line with space***
	+ On if/else/switch or loops: ***same line***
	+ On structs and enums: ***same line***
+ Variable and function names: ***Camel case***
+ Pointer definition has asterisk next to variable name: ```int *pointer```
+ Naming struct objects: ***typedef struct name_with underscores and, before commas, the usual name***
+ Constants: ***upper-case words separated by underscores***
+ Error returns
	+ Element not found in array: ***return ERR(A constant defined as -1)***
	+ Element not found in other data structures with pointer objects: ***NULL***

+ Miscellaneous: No C99 Code shall be allowed with ***risk of an issue being opened***!!!
